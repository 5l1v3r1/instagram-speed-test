# Instagram Speed Test
A regularly-updating website that tests the speed of Instagram scraping tools.

Measures the amount of time it takes to download 500 posts from the 'selfie' hashtag. Measurement is triggered by a push, and a daily cron job.

This website was designed to compare the tools I wrote to scrape Instagram, with the existing tools. For a more thorough comparison, check out [this table](https://github.com/ScriptSmith/instamancer#comparison).
